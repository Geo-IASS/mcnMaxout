Maxout Networks
---

This directory contains a very simple implementation of a maxout and provides 
a simple classification example on CIFAR-10.  It is based on the code of 
[Jia-Ren Chang](https://github.com/JiaRenChang), which can be found 
[here](https://github.com/JiaRenChang/Batch_Normalized_Maxout_NIN).
